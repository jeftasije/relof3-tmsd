    "history.content": "The “Dositej Obradović” Public Library in Novi Pazar has a long and eventful history. It was founded on June 30, 1921, as the first public library in the city. Until then, education and libraries were divided along religious lines — the Muslim and Orthodox Christian populations had separate cultural and educational systems. During World War II, libraries were destroyed or looted, and cultural life came to a halt. After the war, in 1944, efforts to rebuild the library began under modest conditions, driven by the enthusiasm of a new generation. In 1957, it became an independent institution under the name City Library “Dositej Obradović”, and in 1983, it was declared the central (matica) library of the municipality. Over time, the library expanded its collection and services. Since 1996, it has been located in the building of the former “Crvena Zvezda” cinema in the city park. A modern era began in 2006 when it joined the COBISS library system, transitioning to fully automated operations. Today, the library holds around 80,000 books, employs 25 staff members across 10 departments, and serves about 5,000 active members annually. It remains a key institution for culture and education in Novi Pazar.",
